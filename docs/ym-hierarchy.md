## Detailed Structure

                                    Team Leads → Team Members
```

#### National Shura (NS)

The governing body at the national level. The NC is part of NS and serves as its leader.

**Important:**
- Every NS member is associated with **one region** (their geographic home)

### 2. Regional Level

Regions are large geographic areas (e.g., Texas, New York, California, Southeast) and are comprised of several subregions.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     Regional Shura                               │
│  ┌──────────────┐  ┌──────────────┐  ┌──────────────┐          │
│  │ Regional     │  │ Cloud Rep    │  │ Special      │  + SRCs  │
│  │ Coordinator  │  │ (for region) │  │ Projects     │          │
│  │ (leader)     │  │              │  │              │          │
│  └──────────────┘  └──────────────┘  └──────────────┘          │

| **SRCs** | Multiple | Subregional Coordinators sit on Regional Shura |

---

### 3. Subregional Level (SR)

Subregions are collections of NeighborNets within a Region (e.g., Houston, Dallas, NYC East, NJ South).

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Subregional Coordinator (SRC)   │ ◄── Reports to RC, sits on Regional Shura
└───────────────┬─────────────────┘
                │
        ┌───────┴───────┐
        ▼               ▼
┌───────────────┐ ┌─────────────────┐
│ SR Secretary  │ │ NNCs            │
│ General       │ │ (one per NN)    │
└───────────────┘ └─────────────────┘
```

#### Roles at Subregional Level

| Role | Count | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Subregional Coordinator (SRC)** | 1 per SR | Leader of the subregion (part of it too) |
| **SR Secretary General** | 1 per SR | Administrative leadership for the SR |
| **NeighborNet Coordinators (NNCs)** | 1 per NN | Leaders of individual NeighborNets |

**Note:** The Coordinator + Secretary General pattern repeats at multiple levels: NS, Cabinet, and SR each have their own.

---

### 4. NeighborNet Level (NN)

NeighborNets are local community groups - the most grassroots level of the organization.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              Core Team                   │
│  ┌─────────────────────┐                │
│  │ NNC (leader of CT,  │  + CT Members  │
│  │ but also part of CT)│                │
│  └─────────────────────┘                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
                │
                ▼
           Members
```

#### Roles at NeighborNet Level

| Role | Count | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **NeighborNet Coordinator (NNC)** | 1 per NN | Leader of Core Team AND part of Core Team |
| **Core Team Members (CT)** | Multiple | Support the NNC - no specific sub-roles |
| **Members** | Multiple | General participants in the NN |

**Note:** The NNC is both the **leader** of the Core Team and a **member** of it. Core Team doesn't have specialized roles - it's simply NNC + CT members.

---

### 5. Cloud (Parallel Structure)

Cloud is a **parallel track** that exists at every level but runs **adjacent** to the geographic hierarchy - not under it.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                          CLOUD STRUCTURE                                 │
│                                                                          │
│   National Level:     National Cloud Rep (NS member role)                │
│                              │                                           │
│   Regional Level:     Cloud Rep per region (sits on Regional Shura)      │
│                              │                                           │
│   SR Level:           Cloud Coordinator per SR                           │
│                              │                                           │
│                        Cloud Teams / Cloud Members                        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Cloud Roles by Level

| Level | Role | Count | Description |
|-------|------|-------|-------------|
| National | **National Cloud Rep** | 1 | NS member role (the person IS an NS member) |
| Regional | **Cloud Rep** | 1 per region | Sits on Regional Shura |
| SR-adjacent | **Cloud Coordinator** | 1 per SR | Leads cloud in their subregion area |
| SR-adjacent | **Cloud Teams/Members** | Multiple | On-the-ground specialized work |

**Key Points:**
- Cloud is **geographically adjacent** to subregions but **not under SR leadership**
- Cloud does NOT report to SRC or RC - it's a parallel structure
- National Cloud Rep is an **NS member** who holds this functional role
- Regional Cloud Rep sits on Regional Shura but is not an NS member
- **Cloud Rep** = regional level, **National Cloud Rep** = NS role, **Cloud Coordinator** = SR level

---

### 6. Alumni

Former active members who maintain connection to YM.

| Role | Count | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Alumni** | Multiple | Former members, geo-associated with a subregion |

**Key Points:**
- Alumni are **not** part of the leadership structure
- They retain geographic association (subregion) for tracking/community purposes
- No leadership or operational responsibilities

---

## Complete Role Summary

At every level, the Coordinator is both the leader of their group and a member of it—they're not separate from their team.

### Geographic Hierarchy (Leadership Chain)

| Level | Leader | Other Members | Reports To |
|-------|--------|---------------|------------|
| National Shura | National Coordinator | NS members (who hold functional roles like NS SG, Cabinet Chair, etc.) | - |
| The Council | Council Coordinator (NS member) | All RCs | NS |
| Regional Shura | Regional Coordinator | Cloud Rep, Special Projects, SRCs | The Council |
| Subregional | Subregional Coordinator | SR Secretary General, NNCs | RC |
| NeighborNet | NeighborNet Coordinator | Core Team Members | SRC |
|

### Cabinet & National Teams

| Level | Leader | Team | Reports To |
|-------|--------|------|------------|
| Cabinet | Cabinet Chair + Cabinet SG | Department Heads | National Shura |
| Department | Department Head | National Team Leads | Cabinet Chair |
| Team | National Team Lead | National Team Members | Department Head |

**8 Departments:** Marketing, Human Resources, Operations, Special Projects, Fundraising, Finance, IT, Societal Impact

### Cloud

| Level | Role | Count | Reports To |
|-------|------|-------|------------|
| National | National Cloud Rep | 1 | National Shura |
| Regional | Cloud Rep | 1 per region | National Cloud Rep |
| SR-adjacent | Cloud Coordinator | 1 per SR area | Cloud Rep |
| SR-adjacent | Cloud Members | Multiple per SR | Cloud Coordinator |

**Note:** Cloud is parallel/adjacent, not under geographic leadership. National Cloud Rep is an NS member holding this role, not a separate person "sitting on" NS.

### Non-Leadership

| Type | Geographic Association | Notes |
|------|------------------------|-------|
| Members | NeighborNet | General participants |
| Alumni | Subregion | Former members, not in leadership structure |

```

**Key Structures:**
1. **National Shura (NS)**: NC + NS members (each has a geographic home region, many hold functional roles)
2. **The Council**: All RCs, led by Council Coordinator (who is an NS member)
3. **Geographic Chain**: Regional Shura → Subregional → NeighborNet → Members
4. **Cabinet** (national): Cabinet Chair (NS member) → Dept Heads → Team Leads → Members
5. **Cloud** (parallel): Nat'l Cloud Rep (NS role) → Regional Cloud Rep → Cloud Coordinator → Cloud Members
